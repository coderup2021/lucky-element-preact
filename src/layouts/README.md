# Layouts folder

This folder is for layout components or rather *pattern*. Your reflex might be thinking of *styled components* and you would be right. Well, kinda. I mean at least not entirely wrong. I'd like to zoom out one step further here and think layout *patterns*, e.g. *box*, *stack*, *cluster*, *cover*, *center*, etc... One way to implement these is using web-components like [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/) does, if styled components or even sass mixins are what floats your boat i guess that's fine too.
